xfvrp
======

There are alot of solvers for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) on github. Some are good at certain features and others are capable but extremly complex.

xfvrp is a free and easy solver for Rich Vehicle Routing Problems like
- Multi capacities
- Multi time windows
- Multi depots
- Heterogeneous fleet
- Pick and delivery or backhauls
- Replenishment sites
- State of the art optimization heuristics
- and more.
 
Additional topics are the useage and maintainability of the API like
- User shall change only the necessary values. The rest is done by default.
- The API for the user shall be as tight as possible. xfvrp users only need to know one class.
- Presetting to nodes or vehicles for considering real world constraints.
- No free lunch: Good performance for good results.
