 * General concept in classic Container Routing is the independence of routes.
 * A change in one route leaves all decisions in another route valid. So the
 * separation of route plan in several blocks is possible and their union either.
 * 
 * This class provides methods to optimize a big route plan by separating it into
 * several blocks, where each block may contains ALLOWED_NBR_OF_CUSTOMERS_IN_BLOCK
 * number of customers. Each block is optimized by a given optimization procedure.
 * Last but not least the routes of all blocks are joined.
 * 
 * The loss of separation is covered by iteration of this separation and union, where
 * the separation process is randomized. So the set of routes is different in each 
 * iteration. If optimization can not found an improvement in at least one block for
 * ALLOWED_NON_IMPROVES times, the search process will be terminated.
